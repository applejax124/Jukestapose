Client-server application suite for playing and sharing music.

# Motivation

Friends tend to study and do homework together often.  Lots of times we find ourselves sitting side
by side, with our headphones on, sending each other links to songs we are currently jamming out to.
Occasionally, we find ourselves singing along to a song we are listening to and have everyone join
in. This prompts the immediate pausing of all other music and the unplugging of the headphones
currently transferring the signal of the current jam. How much easier would it be if we could all
just add our songs to a collective queue that would play each song choice from each person's queue
in a round robin fashion from one central set of speakers? 

Hence Jukestapose was born!

This project was originally created for a hackathon, and has remained mostly stagnant for the past
few years. We would like to improve upon it and make it more usable/fully featured.
